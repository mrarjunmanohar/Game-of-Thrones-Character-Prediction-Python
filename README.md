# Game-of-Thrones-Character-Prediction-Python
Multi-model classification development using Game of Thrones character survival prediction dataset

The following is a multi-model classification model developement. The code is divided into 3 main sections:
1. EDA
2. Feature Engineering
3. Multi-Classification Modelling 
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - KNN Classifier
  - GBM Classifier

<h4>Model Summary</h4>

<h4>Model Summary</h4>

The Gradient Boosting Model was the best with a AUC of 0.74. Key insights were as follows:
- Higher the character's popularity, higher the likelihood of survial
- In the context of the books, if you are born to House Valyrian, your likelihood of survial is less than 5%
- A character that makes into book 2 has a higher likelihood of survial than any other books in the series
